[Overview of aws](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

# TL;DR;

```

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DTC)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami aws-cli Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/aws-cli).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/aws-cli:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/aws-cli/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/aws-cli:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/aws-cli:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-aws-cli.git#master:1/debian-10'
```

# Configuration

## Running commands

To run commands inside this container you can use `docker run`, for example to execute `aws-cli --version` you can follow the example below:
